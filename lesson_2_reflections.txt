What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you are setting up git to begin tracking all changes.  You need to do it because git does not track every single file...you need to tell it which ones you want to track.  Then initializing it allows it to take a snap shot at the place you want to begin tracking.
