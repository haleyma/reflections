Why would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping it centrally allows multiple people to be working with the same code.  Also, allows me to access it from different 
computers and also allows me to have a saved copy incase something happens to my personal computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

It allows you to keep the files on your personal computer independent from any changes that happen on Github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks make a copy of someone else's repository in your GitHub account - makes a new repository in your account with the same name.

Clones copy a repository and all it's commits to your home computer and makes a git remote on your computer.

Fork to copy something on GitHub...clone to move it to my computer to make changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Gives you a starting point from which to begin working offline.  You can work offline
if you don't have internet access.  It gives you the point at which you began working.
